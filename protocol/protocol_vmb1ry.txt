    DATABYTE5 = low byte of delay time

    Remark:
    [DATABYTE3][DATABYTE4][DATABYTE5] contain a 24-bit time in seconds
    If the time parameter contains zero then the timer starts for a time set by the hex switches on the relay module. If the hex
    switches are set at momentary mode there will be no action. If the hex switches are set at toggle mode, the relay switches
    permanently on.
    If the time parameter contains H’FFFFFF’ then the relay switches permanently on.
